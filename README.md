openPSTD [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/micfort/openDG.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/micfort/openDG)
========

openPSTD is an open source initiative to provide an intuitive visual interface for the Pseudo-Spectral Time-Domain 
method to simulate the propagation of sound. Documentation on openPSTD can be found 
[here](http://www.openpstd.org/wiki/index.php/OpenPSTD). Version 1.0 and 1.1 of openPSTD are written in Python and 
these are released as Blender plugins; for instruction on installation, see **Installation**.

A C++ port of openPSTD is currently under development and will be released as a standalone application. An extension of this application is the use of DG-FEM to support arbitrary polygon geometries(in PSTD only rectangles are supported). The progress of this is found in this repo.

License
=======

openPSTD is licensed under the GPL open source license, because we think it is important for our users to have the 
freedom to use and adapt openPSTD freely in their academic and commercial projects. Furthermore, we believe in a 
collaboratively development model and we welcome contributions from other experts. Note that conditions apply if you 
wish to redistribute a modified version of openPSTD. 

Installation
============

Download the most recent release of openPSTD from [this link](http://openpstd.org/Download%20openPSTD.html) and 
install the add-on by clicking on the 'Install from File...' button in the User Preferences > Addons window in 
Blender. Blender 2.70 or newer is required to run the add-on.

Some additional work is required to enable GPU acceleration. For a detailed explanation, refer to the relevant page
